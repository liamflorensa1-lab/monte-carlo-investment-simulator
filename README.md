# monte-carlo-investment-simulator
A beginner-friendly Python project to simulate possible future values of an investment using Monte Carlo methods.
# Monte Carlo Investment Simulator

This project simulates possible future values of a small investment
using historical stock data and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Why I built this project
I am a student learning Python and basic data analysis.
This project helped me understand:
- investment risk
- uncertainty in markets
- how simulations work

## Technologies used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- yfinance

## What the project does
- simulates multiple possible future scenarios
- shows best and worst case outcomes
- helps visualize investment risk

This project is for learning purposes.
